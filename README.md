# TSE
Triple stellar evolution code

TSE1 contains the "old" version written in Fortran using BSE ([Stegmann et al, 2022](https://doi-org.abc.cardiff.ac.uk/10.1093/mnras/stac2192)).
TSE2 contains the "new" version where MOBSE is imported as a python module (work in progress). 

For any questions contact Jakob Stegmann (StegmannJ@cardiff.ac.uk).
